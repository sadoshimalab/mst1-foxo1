# Project Description of Mst1/CEBP-β/FoxO1 mediated response to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion 

In this study we show how Mst1, a pivotal mediator of Hippo pathway, orchestrates myocardial cell response to ischemia and reperfusion injury via phosphorylation and dimerization and nuclear localization of CEBP-β and FoxO1 transcriptions factors. Binding of CEBP-β and FoxO1 transcription factors to proapoptotic, autophagy and pro-survival related genes have been studied via ChIP-seq. The related codes can be found here.
